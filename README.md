Hi there, I'm Alex</a> ðŸ‘‹

<h2 align="center">
I have finished working on the tech challenge and here you can find the code!
</h2> 

I thoroughly enjoyed the entire process of developing this!

- ðŸ’¬ If you have any question/feedback, please do not hesitate to reach out to me!

## Description

### [App](https://github.com/n54b30/tech-challenge/tree/main/app)

- Dockerfile -> lighter than a CokeZero with 0 vulnerabilities as scanned on Snyk, size 25mb
- requirements.txt -> python dependencies
- print_timestamp.py -> original code supplied 
- main.py -> my Python code, this is a basic Flask Python app that launches a subprocess every time the function is called at the / of the webpage
I included two other functions that return HTTP response 200 and 500 for the @app.route just so I can generate more replies for the integrated load tester and the Grafana dashboard.(more on that in just a sec!)
Also introduced a library needed for exporting the metrics from the Flask application to a Prometheus instance. 

###  [Generator](https://github.com/n54b30/tech-challenge/tree/main/generator)
- generate_events.py -> script that picks at random endpoints and keeps sending requests for generating load for testing autoscaling
- Dockerfile -> just another Dockerfile, 0 vulnerabilities, size 25mb
- requirements.txt -> python dependencies

### [Grafana](https://github.com/n54b30/tech-challenge/tree/main/grafana)
- grafana config & dashboard files

### [Helmchart](https://github.com/n54b30/tech-challenge/tree/main/helmchart)
- Helm chart for deploying with Helm. 
- You may also install it like so:
helm repo add tech-challenge https://n54b30.github.io/tech-challenge/
helm install my-demochart tech-challenge/demochart --version 0.1.0

### [Manual_gke_provisioning](https://github.com/n54b30/tech-challenge/tree/main/manual_gke_provisioning)
- Collection of yaml files that can be applied with kubectl -f . for a working cluster in GKE.

### [Prometheus](https://github.com/n54b30/tech-challenge/tree/main/prometheus)
- Prometheus and its config file

### Terraform
- Will create a separate VPC and separate subnets for the Kubernetes cluster, create the K8 cluster and deploy the Helm chart
- Will create a two node cluster with machine type: n1-standard-1
- Requires helm, terraform, gcloud SDK and a service account key (json) with enough privileges. 


### LINKS
The GKE cluster will expose the Grafana dashboard and the Flask application at these links:
- GRAFANA = http://lb-ip:3000/d/_eX4mpl3
- FLASK = http://lb-ip:5000/

### Notes
- Prometheus nor Grafana have any persistent volume claims, I would attach an NFS share in production for this. 
- All K8 deployments come with ConfigMaps defined
- Cluster monitoring is possible as well but wasn't mentioned under bonus objectives, at the same time a deployment on GKE has observability by default. 
- Default namespace used
- If you want to spin it locally all you have to do is docker-compose up
- Prototyped everything on GCP
- HPA autoscaling is configured in all deployment scenarios (manual, helm or terraform)
- Edit terraform.tfvars for declaring your GCP project and region
